People fight for their life every day because of lack of nutrition. It's horrible to see people face this kind of problem daily. Every crumb means so much to them and we have to work to supply them with enough to keep them healthy. We can reduce that amount and help people all over the world.   </h1>

                    <p class="p" style="text-align: center;"> Hunger is a problem all around the world. Many think that people in Arica are the only ones affected, but Asia is actually the hungriest continent. 2/3 of those who face hunger live in Asia. Hunger is not a small problem. We see families all over fighting for nutrition and little is done to help them. People are not fortunate enough to be able to supply themselves, their friends, or their families enough to keep them healthy. The whole world sees this, yet not much is done for them.   </p>

Not only are they starving throughout the day, but their learning is also affected. 66 primary school age children have to face this problem every day. Studies show that school performance is affected when children attend classes hungry. They lose knowledge and the ability to learn more because of lack of nutritition.  </h1>
